<center><h1><p style="color:blue;">LACK OF TECHNOLOGY </h1></center>

<p style="font-size:20px;"><b>PROBLEM STATEMENT: </b>Little or no use of machines is made in ploughing, sowing, irrigating, weeding, harvesting, threshing and transporting the crops. Lack of mechanization reduces the efficiency and productivity of farming, as well as increases drudgery and labour cost.

<p style="font-size:20px;">The implementation of smart agricultural technology is advantageous for all players in the agri-food chain. With its use in optimizing and automating agricultural operations and field activities, growers and landowners can now save significant amounts of time and effort. These are just a few examples of how farming has benefited from advances in agriculture technology:

<p><p style="font-size:20px;"><b>*</b> Using less water, fertilizer, pesticides, and other inputs allows agricultural producers to cut costs and keep more of their profits.</p>

<p><p style="font-size:20px;"><b>*</b>By preventing or drastically reducing the amount of chemical runoff into waterways, businesses lessen agricultureâ€™s impact on the environment and take steps toward greater sustainability.</p>


<p><p style="font-size:20px;"><b>*</b><u>Increasing crop yields</u> while decreasing labor inputs.</p>


<p><p style="font-size:20px;"><b>*</b>Making it easier for farmers, agronomists, or other agricultural workers to communicate and coordinate activities using mobile devices, apps, or web-based resources.</p>


<p><p style="font-size:20px;"><b>*</b>Lowering barriers to accessing agricultural insurance and financial services as well as market and technological data.</p>


<p><p style="font-size:20px;"><b>*</b>Mitigation of the damage that could be caused by pests, natural calamities, and bad<u> weather in agriculture</u>with the help of affordable, always-on agricultural monitoring systems.</p>


<p><p style="font-size:20px;"><b>*</b>Increase in farm income through improved product quality and increased quality controls.</p>


<p><p style="font-size:20px;"><b>*</b>Timely recognizing<u> nutrient deficiency in plants</u>and notifying agricultural producers of the type and amount of fertilizer and other amendments needed.</p>


<p><p style="font-size:20px;"><b>*</b>Ability to foresee potential problems on the farm through the visualization of production patterns and trends gleaned from an analysis of current and historical agricultural data. By estimating their overall crop yield, agricultural producers can precisely budget for the next growing season and better prepare for emergencies.</p>

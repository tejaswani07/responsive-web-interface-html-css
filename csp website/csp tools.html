<p><p style="font-size:20px;"><b>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</b>Appropriate agricultural tools and equipment should contribute to the broad objective of increasing the viability of the small farm. Where small farmers arecurrently employing traditional technologies that are   inefficient, they often cannot improve this technologybecause of the leap in scale and capital cost to commercially available equipment.</p>

<p><p style="font-size:20px;">1.<b>TROWELS(planting/digging):</b>It is comparable to a spade or shovel, but is generally much smaller, being designed for use with one hand. It is used for breaking up earth, digging small holes, especially for planting and weeding, mixing in fertilizer or other additives, and transferring plants to pots.

<p><p style="font-size:20px;">2.<b>RAKE(leveling):</b>Rakes are used as a broom for collecting fallen leaves, grass and hay. It is also useful in loosening of soil, leveling and light weeding etc. When functionality is considered, this tool can be regarded as a synonym to harrow used in agriculture. Rakes normally belongs to two categories- Hand Rakes and Hay Rakes.

<p><p style="font-size:20px;">3.<b>SPADE:</b>Digging is done with a spade. It is used for breaking ground and chopping through tree roots and other tough stuff. Planting trees, excavating garden beds, removing grass, and cutting garden margins all need the use of a spade in the garden.

<p><p style="font-size:20px;">4.<b>SPRINKLER:</b>An irrigation sprinkler (also known as a water sprinkler or simply a sprinkler) is a device used to irrigate (water) agricultural crops, lawns, landscapes, golf courses, and other areas.

<p><p style="font-size:20px;">9.<b>CULTIVATORS:</b>Cultivator are used to prepare the soil for farming. They are used to remove weeds. They make soil loose and pulverized to help in cultivation. Cultivators are self-propelled and are easy to use.

<p><p style="font-size:20px;">10.<b>PRUNER:</b>Pruning is crucial for removing dead or diseased branches, which helps prevent the spread of disease and pests within a crop.

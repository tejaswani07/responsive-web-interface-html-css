<h1>GARDENING TIPS</h1>
<h2>Pick the right spot.</h2>
<p> Taking small steps towards big wins is always better. Pick a small space to start building your garden.

Ensure that your chosen space receives 5-6 hours of direct sunlight. Avoid a space that receives strong winds, it could knock over your young and budding plants. The wind will also keep pollinators from doing their job.

Lastly, think about the accessibility of your garden space for watering, picking, and caring for your plants. As they say, out of sight often equals out of mind.</p>

<h2>Pick a type.</h2>

<p>Once you identify the right spot for your garden, the next step in your journey to gardening is choosing what type of garden you want.
Will it be a beautiful sea full of flowers, a gorgeous spread of herbs, a kitchen garden for the budding chef in you, or a nutritious vegetable garden to keep you fit and healthy? No matter what you choose, take small steps to paint the picture of your perfect garden.</p>

<h2>Work on the soil.</h2>

<p>Plants always benefit from the nutrient-rich gardening soil. Take your first step by examining the texture of your soil, it should be easily shoveled and crumble in your hands.

If your soil is hard and the texture is clay-like, it will be difficult for all the plants to grow their roots. If you have rocky soil, till the soil and remove the rocks.

Improving the quality of the soil is not as hard a task as you think, it comes with great benefits. Add organic compost made of tea compost, and vegetable peels, to your soil to improve its quality.</p>

Once you have a plan, you’ll need some basic gardening tools to get started. We’re listing a handful of tools required for gardening. You will require:

The must-haves: One tool that every gardener should own is a pair of pruning scissors. You will be using these to cut back plants and bushes, as well as maintain their health by cutting off the dead parts of these plants. 
Tools for digging: You will need a couple of tools for digging and preparing your soil to start planting your greens. You will need a spade, a trowel, and a garden fork. The spade and trowel are used to dig the holes for your plants, whereas the garden fork is used for breaking the large clumps of soil or for clearing the roots of old plants and weeds. 
Tools for watering: The best tools for generously watering your garden are garden hose (pipe) and a watering can. Garden hose is perfect for bigger tasks such as watering trees and larger areas. For delicate and small plants, a watering can is preferred. Your young plants cannot take the high pressure and will thank you for the gentle sprinkling. 
Tools for weeding: To tackle the weed problem and get rid of these unwanted plants, you will require a forked trowel and a gardening knife. These two handy tools will allow you to keep the invading plants away.

<h2>Pick your plants.</h2>
<p>Now comes the most exciting part of the gardening process - picking your greens. Before you rush to a conclusion on what to grow in your garden, take some time to study the plants.

Some plants like direct sunlight while others prefer shade. You can check your plant seed package for this information. Picking the plants that are native to your area can make your life very easy, especially when you are about to become a plant parent.

You can also take a peek at your neighbours garden to see what plants are growing well in their garden or read our guide on which are the best vegetables to grow by month.

These methods will give you a fair idea of what type of plants will thrive in your garden.</p>

<h2>Plan It Out.</h2>
<p>Before getting your hands dirty and starting to plant your greens, plan it out!

Planning: Map out where each and every plant will go, paying detailed attention to spacing. Like us, plants also need their own space. If you place young plants too close to each other, their growth can get affected, they will be more prone to diseases, or may simply die.  

Labelling: We are all forgetful in nature. To ensure that you know what is planted where in your garden and to identify these plants, take some time to make small labels and place them alongside your plants. You can even get creative with your labels and come up with some unique ways to label your plants.

Organizing: Another great piece of advice for beginners is to make their own garden scrapbook and chart out the progress of the garden. You can add sketches, pictures, labels, and notes to keep a track of how each plant progressed in different parts of your garden and then make a progress report to understand the nature of these plants.</p>

<h2>Water your plants right.</h2>

<p>The goal of watering your plants is to give them enough water to sustain but overwatering your plants can lead to waterlogging which can damage your plants.

The best way to water your plants is slowly, allowing the water to reach deep into the soil. Ideally, the soil should get moist at about 3-4 inches beneath the surface. Plants need more water in the summer heat. Read our guide on watering plants in summer for optimal plant growth in summer.

Plants at different stages of development also require different dosages of water. Young plants will need to be watered every day to encourage the growth of the plant and healthy roots, whereas developed plants will need to be watered once every 2-3 days, depending on the weather conditions.
<h2> Nurture with organic fertilizers.</h2>
<p>There's an old saying, “The fertilizer is the gardener's best friend.” Make your own organic fertilizer to give your plants the extra boost to grow.

Start with compost - organic material that can be added to your garden to help your plants grow. This can be anything from tea bags, grounded coffee, lawn trimmings, crushed fruit peels, etc. Adding these organic fertilizers to your soil will help it to retain moisture, stimulate good bacteria growth, and fight pests and diseases. It will also help you to reduce your carbon footprint.</p>

<h2>Keep pests and diseases away.</h2>

<p>Pests and diseases are more attracted to plants that are stressed or have some deficiency. If you have healthy, well-nourished plants, your pest and disease problems should be lesser. If your plants get infected, chances are there's an organic solution.

It's easy to make up homemade pest control for the yard and garden that use plant compounds and soap to knock out the bugs feasting on your plants. Mix up some neem oil, water and a few drops of dish soap. Shake it well and spray it on your plants once every two weeks to keep the pests away!</p>
